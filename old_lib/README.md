## Libraries

This folder contains the striped-down versions of the libraries required by the
WebP2P library. "Striped-down" here means removed all the test, READMEs and
LICENSEs files in order to reduce the distribution size in the case that there's
no minimized and/or production ready version, being the original source code
files untouched.
