1.  Introduction

    This specification describes a protocol to create an interconnect
    several machines on a P2P network using WebRTC DataChannel objects.
    It could be also be used as a WebSockets subprotocol or over any
    other bi-directional transport layer like BoSH using a server that
    can connect the peers between them for example in a connections's
    pool, specially required during the initial handshake. It is based
    on JSON [JSON] messages. The actions the interface exposes are:

        * presence: notify our presence on a pool of connections so that
          other older peers can send to us request to create a direct
          connection. This message is not required when using other
          peers for the handshake.

        * offer: ask to a peer to create a direct connection

        * answer: response to a previous offer message

    The exact details of these three actions are described in this
    specification.

2. Terminology

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [WORDS].

    "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" are appropriate when valid exceptions to a
    general requirement are known to exist or appear to exist, and it is
    infeasible or impractical to enumerate all of them.  However, they
    should not be interpreted as permitting implementors to fail to
    implement the general requirement when such failure would result in
    interoperability failure.

    "UID" is an unique ID that identify the peer on all the network,
    both selected by the user (so it can be easily reacheable) or
    assigned automatically. In that last case, for annonimity it's
    recommended to use the UUID scheme [UUID], version 4 (random).

    "Handshake server" is a third party service external to the P2P
    network used to help on the initial bootstrapping of the peers. It
    can be used any transport layer that allow one-to-one communications
    and to send presence notifications (or one-to-many communications
    instead), desirelly in an anonimous way. Examples of this are PubNub
    servers, XMPP, PuSH protocol or private timelines on microblogging
    sites.

3. Messages

3.1. Serialization and communication scheme

    Communication is done using a simplified version of JSON-RPC, using
    arrays to store the command in string format on the first position,
    and the arguments of that command in their most natural format
    (boolean, integer, string, object...) on the other ones. The array
    is stringified using the JSON format previously to be send. Ending
    'falsy' arguments (0, null, undefined, void...) are not added to the
    arguments list to earn bandwidth and should be filled ad-hoc by the
    receiver. Once the command is serialized, it would be like in the
    next example:

    ["command.name", true, "arg 2", 3.0, 4, [1,2,3,4,5], "6th argument"]

    On the receiver end, the JSON string would be parsed and an array
    with this items in the same order they were sended will be created.

    Communication is done in a totally asynchronous way, not waiting for
    an answer and processing all the messages in the order they are
    being received, no matter if a response was being waited from a
    previous request or not.

3.2. Presence

    Presence message is used to notify our presence when connecting to a
    handshake server so other (older) peers connected to it can send to
    us connection offers, so we can integrate on the P2P network. It's
    just the command 'presence' with the UID of the new peer as the only
    one argument, like:

    ["presence","550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"]

    After sending the presence message, the peer keeps waiting listening
    for the arrival of presence messages from new peers, choosing to
    send them a connection offer or not according to the number of newer
    peers it got connected thanks to this handshake server.

    When it got connected to a predefined number of newer peers (a
    "critic mass") it disconnect itself and start using exclusively the
    P2P network to discover new peers, allowing to new peers to use the
    handshake server and increasing network arity.

    The method to choose if the peer should connect to the newer peer or
    not is left to the developer, but the next three algorythms are
    proposed:

        * connect to all newer peers. This allow to quickly increase the
          number of connections with newer peers, but all of them would
          be in a reduced slice of time.

        * connect randomly: this allow a greater time arity of the
          network, but would spend a lot of time to get the critic mass
          and disconnect.

        * connect on increasing intervals: increase progresively the
          number of "leap" peers when connecting to them, both randomly
          or numerically. This would spend a lot of time to get the full
          critic mass, but also will assure that we got a big enought
          number of peers just after connecting to the handshake server.

    After disconnecting from the handshake server, it's left to the
    developer if it should connect to a new one (if available) or not.

3.3. Handshaking

3.3.1. Offer

    When a peer want to connect to another one, both on the initial
    handshake with a new peer after being notified of its presence or to
    make a transfer, it sends an 'offer' message. It has the destination
    UID as first argument, the offer SDP as second one and an array as
    third one having a list of the peers where the message have been
    routed, being empty on first instance. An example message would be:

    ["offer",
     "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
     <offer SDP string>,
     []]

    After checking that we don't really have a connection to that peer,
    in case the connection is for a new peer it is send directly over
    the handshake server connection where we got notified about it,
    otherwise it is broadcasted over all our current connections. When
    the offer message reaches a peer check if it's the one desired (the
    one on the destination field) and if not, append the UID of the peer
    where we receive it on the route field. Handshake server are
    considered regular peers for routing purposes, so they have a
    descriptor (usually the service name) as UID.

    Later the peer check in the destination field its one of its
    connections. If so, it sends the message directly to him but if not,
    it broadcast the message over all its current connections (except
    the one where it got the message or the ones already routed) as it
    was done with the original message flooding all the P2P network just
    to find a route to it, if it really exists.

    To prevent the message to being running infinitelly on the network,
    previously to being processed and dispatched it is check if our peer
    UID is on the route argument, showing us that this message have been
    previously routed by us and discarding it.

    When the offer message reaches the desired peer a new PeerConnection
    is created to hold the connection with the requested peer if we
    don't have it already, and apply to it the SDP from the message.

3.3.2. Answer

    After processing the offer message, a new 'answer' message is
    generated. This message has the origination (the UID of the peer
    that send the answer message) as the first parameter, the answer SDP
    and the offer route, so it can be runned backward looking the peer
    that sended the offer message. An example message would be:

    ["answer",
     "1a66b984-89d3-11e2-8bc3-4f265af2680c",
     <answer SDP string>,
     ["550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "1b70093e-89d3-11e2-90c8-2f82ef7d7182"]]

    When a peer receive an answer message it check if it was sended back
    to us or the route array got empty and we don't know where to send
    it, so it's ignored. After that, we check if it was send to us
    (looking if the first UID on the route array if ours) so connection
    can be stablished with the SDP that's attached on the message, or we
    can re-send it back running over the route array. In that case, run
    over all the UIDs on the route array looking for possibly newly
    connected peers while the offer/answer dance was being done that
    would allow some shortcuts on the route sending back the answer
    message, and send to them it. In case no connected peer was found on
    the route (maybe they got disconnected), then send the message by
    broadcast so the message can look the path to the offering peer.

    When a connection is stablished between two PeerConnection objects,
    is suggested that both ends create new DataChannels that can be used
    for routing purposses to increase the network arity. This newly
    created DataChannels can be used for application specific usage too.
